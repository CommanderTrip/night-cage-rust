# night-cage-rust

This is an implementation of the fun board game [The Night Cage](https://www.thenightcage.com/) in Rust. I really 
enjoyed playing the game and decided to try and recreate it in Rust using the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

This is the _FIRST GAME_ I have ever made and look forward to all the fun and new learning experiences I will gain in 
the process. The code will remain open sourced _FOREVER_, and credits for the original game go to:

- **Chris Chan**
