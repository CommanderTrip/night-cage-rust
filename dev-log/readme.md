# Purpose of the Dev Logs

My goal is to journal my experiences each time I work on this project: what did I learn, what are my thoughts, what did
I like or dislike. I also want to include notes on the changes I made: why did I make them, what was my thought process,
did it work or not.

This is my first game project, so I want to document my experiences ðŸ˜€. I seek to give it my best shot and improve as I
go along!
