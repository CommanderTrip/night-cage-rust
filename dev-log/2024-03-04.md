## BLUF

- Can now query Main Menu buttons and apply unique actions to each.
- Code UI feels weird but I'll get more comfortable with it.

Today, I wanted to figure out how to give buttons different actions in the main menu. In Bevy, there did not seem to be
a way to attach unique event listeners to buttons like you can with other frameworks. This way of creating these
buttons, attaching a component to it, query for that component, then act upon it feels weird, but I might get used to
it. For now, IT WORKS and I can define my buttons with actions (come-on, I'm taking the small wins where I can as I
learn this engine). Next, I need to navigate UI 'pages' when clicking the buttons.

I also figured out that I do not like code UI. It feels messy and ... verbose? I'd rather create my UI's with
some markup language like HTML or XML, but perhaps this only feels bad for the UI and not when I am manipulating
entities in the world. Upon a quick research of the pros and cons, I understand the benefits each can bring and suspect
my preference with markup UI is because that is what I have used most of my career so far with Android XML layouts and
Web HTML.
